						<p>[READ SLIDE]</p>
						<p>Believe it or not, there are some people, like me, who enjoy the organizational part of writing CSS more than we enjoy making something pretty or animated or a better interaction. I like making a CSS file that is organized and commented, that other people can read and use <strong>with joy</strong>, and I feel that the end result (the designed website) is way better when the code is better.</p>
						<p>And I believe it makes sense to have a separate role for this, not just foist this work off on all your front-end devs.</p>
						<p>Front-end dev has gotten SO complex these days that we can't assume that all devs care about this. We can't leave a gap of responsibilities, like visual regression testing, linting, or building internal tools and documentation, and hope it will get done a little bit by everyone. It's time we put focus on this, as it deserves, rather than being an afterthought.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Micah Godbolt gave a great talk at CSSDevConf called Raising a Flag for the Front End Architect, and in it this is how he defined FEA.</p>

						<p>Micah’s talk covered the following potential responsibilities:</p>

						<li>Coding Standards - HTML, CSS and Sass/LESS/etc, JavaScript</li>
						<li>Documentation</li>
						<li>Style Guides or Pattern Libraries, “a common language”</li>
						<li>Regression Testing</li>
						<li>Dependency Management, package managers, etc</li>
						<li>Build Systems, Grunt/Gulp/etc</li>
						<li>Linting, Compiling, Minifying, etc</li>
						<li>Performance Optimization for CSS, JS, images, asset caching</li>
						<li>Continuous Integration</li>

						<p>I’d go on to say that a quality Front-End Architect might also be responsible for:</p>

						<li>understanding the cascade, inheritance, semantics, and being able to choose the best style of CSS organization for the project (not necessarily their favorite)</li>
						<li>organizing and building UI modules, working closely with UX or more visually-focused designers/CSS developers</li>
						<li>consistency of modules, look and feel, UI interactions</li>
						<li>creating file and folder structure and naming conventions, for HTML and CSS, most likely JS as well, and helping define back-end naming conventions for consistency</li>
						<li>understanding the technological and business implications of a task, technical debt, and “perfect is the enemy of done”</li>

						<p>Because this [POINT AT SLIDE] is difficult to parse, as a human. And the efficiency gains of a longer classname list, for the browser, is typically not significant.</p>

						<p>We want a dev who may not understand CSS very well to not have to worry about where to add code, or if will cause specificity issues.</p>

					<h3>LONG TERM MAINTENANCE</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>what is “long term”? for a client project, or a prototype, long term might be 3-6 months, a year. you need front end code that can withstand a few changes, but not many people touching it, etc.</p>
						<p>Salesforce is ~15 years old — lots of original code.</p>
						<p>Retailmenot’s site is over 4 years old—and in many places it’s the same code as when we purchased it in 2010. RMN has ~50-60 devs, a big design/product team, and 5-10 features or A/B tests on various parts of the site at any given time. ops has scaled, deployment has scaled, but the css/front end has not.</p>
						<p>lots of time to have to live with your technical decisions! long term takes on a different meaning when you think that the tech choices you are making could be things you live with for 5, 10 years.</p>

					<h3>Technical Debt</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So we all know the concept of technical debt...</p>

				<section>
					<h3><span class="faded">Technical</span> Savings</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>but what about technical savings?</p>
						<p>Technical Savings: Well-designed code, planned to satisfy future needs. Technical Savings are a form of wealth that makes a module more maintainable, extensible or reusable.</p>
						<p>Technical Savings are the result of some extra work. We must invest in the design of our modules so that they are indeed more maintainable, extensible and reusable. But we must believe that this investment will pay itself in the future. If done right, the efforts invested in accumulating Technical Savings should be smaller than the efforts required in the alternative of incurring technical debt and then paying this debt through successive refactors.</p>

					<h3>HUMAN READABLE CODE.</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So here are just a few things that differ when you're architecting CSS/Sass for a large scale project, for internal consumers, rather than writing CSS that goes straight to the browser.</p>
						<p>First of all, and I can't stress this enough: human readable code.</p>
						<p>The browser doesn't care, and when you send code to the browser you want it to be squished and minified and ugly—but as a front end architect, you're not writing code for the browser. You're writing code for humans.</p>

						<p>Ben Frain:</p>
						<p>Don’t write impenetrable looking code. CSS is a declarative language so try and keep the authoring style sheets as accessible as the resultant CSS. Mixins and logical loops are sometimes preferable and advantageous (they can greatly reduce verbosity and repetition in the authoring style sheets) but don’t needlessly complicate simple needs. </p>
						<p>Try to create one-to-one parity of your HTML, CSS, JS, folder names, so you always know exactly what to look for</p>
						<p>And of course, prefer unambigious names over acronyms, or shorthand, or making people guess about what they're looking for.</p>

					<h6>—Ben Frain</h6>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Name-spacing the CSS of each visual component can be used to create some form of isolation. By preventing name collisions with other components, chunks of CSS can be more easily moved one environment to another (from prototype to production for example).</p>
						<p>“As name-spaced components are almost guaranteed to not leak into other components it makes it incredibly easy to build out and iterate on new components as new design requests are received. It affords a hitherto un-afforded blanket of impunity.</p>
						<p>This approach however is not without cost. This approach has greater potential for code duplication (you may be styling one item in a component that could be abstracted and easily used in another component) but I find it results in far more maintainable code – whole components can be removed in the safe knowledge that their removal will not affect others.</p>

						<p>“In a rapidly changing large project, where many different people touch CSS, I find that more CSS bloat accumulates due to author deletion fear than duplicated styles.</p>

					<h3>MODULAR, REUSABLE, <br/>COMPOSABLE CODE.</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>My goal when writing CSS for enduring and rapidly changing web application is long-term maintainability.</p>
						<p>It's important to understand output and the tradeoffs in file size, selector output/css bloat, and ease of authoring and reuse.</p>
						<p>Composition is the idea that an html component might “contain” other styles, rather than “inheriting” those styles. You can see this principle used extensively in OOCSS, BEM and Sass @extends. Instead of layers of styles, each overriding the last, these approaches embrace the Single Responsibility Principle.</p>

					<p>easily reusable code <span class="faded">> the cleanest code to the browser</span></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>It's important here to <em>understand</em> the cascade, use it to your advantage, but also reduce the places where you can create cascading or specificity issues.</p>
						<p>we don’t care what the css that the browser sees looks like—it's all compressed, non-dynamic code now — yes, we care about perf, no we don’t want eighteen selector long declarations, but ultimately as an author...</p>
						<p>...being able to delete an entire Sass partial (say 9KB) in six months time with impunity (in that I know what will and won’t be affected by the removal) is far more valuable to me than a 1KB saving enjoyed because I re-used or extended some vague abstracted styles.“</p>
